- Briefly explain the vulnerability and why the secure version prevents the vulnerability.
- What additional security mechanisms can you incorporate to prevent such attacks?

The insecure version is lacking input handling, which can lead to server crashes due to DoS attacks. 
The secure version uses try-catch to handle the inputs so that 400 code is sent and server does not crash.
Mechanisms such as input validation and rate limiting can prevent such attacks.
