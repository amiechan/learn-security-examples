Briefly explain the vulnerability and why the secure version prevents the vulnerability.
Which CIA property does tampering violate?
What additional security mechanisms can you incorporate?

The lack of input validation or sanitization can make it susceptible to NoSQL injection attacks.
The secure version does the input validation and sanitization to prevent this. 
This violates confidentiality and integrity because the attacker can 
manipulate or change the behavior of the database by injection. 
Security mechanisms such as endpoint permissions to prevent information from being manipulated.
