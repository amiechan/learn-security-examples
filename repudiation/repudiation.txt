- Briefly explain the vulnerability and why the secure version is better at preventing repudiation than the insecure version.
- What additional security mechanisms can you incorporate to prevent such attacks?

The insecure server lacks logging or user authentication for messages so that
user actions cannot be verified. The secure version uses logging and authentication
to ensure only logged-in users are doing actions. 
Using additional authentication methods can be used to verify a users identity.
